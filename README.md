# TimeSereies-LSTM-Tesla_stock_price_prediction
### Predicting the future values of the Tesla stock price based on the available values.
### LSTM Model:
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points (e.g. images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video inputs).LSTM models are able to store information over a period of time.


Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given asset, security, or economic variable changes over time. It can also be used to examine how the changes associated with the chosen data point compare to shifts in other variables over the same time period.For example, suppose you wanted to analyze a time series of daily closing stock prices for a given stock over a period of one year. You would obtain a list of all the closing prices for the stock from each day for the past year and list them in chronological order.



### Dataset:
The date - "Date"

The opening price of the stock - "Open"

The high price of that day - "High"

The low price of that day - "Low"

The closed price of that day - "Close"

The amount of stocks traded during that day - "Volume"

The stock's closing price that has been amended to include any distributions/corporate actions that occurs before next days open - "Adj Close"

The dataset used for this project was collected from kaggle.
